# Lightning Web Component â€“ Preview & Download Attachments


Recently in one of my project, I need to develop a custom lightning web component which will display all the attachments linked with that record and provide a preview and download option. Here in this repo, I am going to share the code snippet. 

## Important

My requirement is little different in the project where it is already a custom page with lots of lightning web components and they want to display the attachments. So I have to build this custom solution.
